# Psychic Petals

> **Psychic Petals** is an open-source **magical realism** and **slice of life** novel. While the world features a corporate-regulated hero ecosystem and psionic societies, the narrative focuses on the quiet, personal moments of its characters rather than superhero action or monster-slaying mechanics.
>
> The story follows Damien, a young man with the rare ability to manifest his imagination into physical constructs, as he navigates the complexities of school, social isolation, and the weight of his unspoken dreams.

> [!WARNING]
> **Spoiler Alert:** If you want to experience the story as intended, avoid the `outlines/` and `story-bible/` directories. These contain plot spoilers, character secrets, and deep lore that may reveal future events.

2. Follow the episodes and chapters in numerical order.
3. Read the scene files (e.g., `01-...`, `02-...`) sequentially.
